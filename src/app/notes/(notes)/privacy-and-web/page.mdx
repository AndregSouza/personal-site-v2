# Redesigning my portfolio
<time> Posted: January 03, 2020 </time>

The idea of having your own website always sounded exciting to me. My first website coded in HTML, CSS, JS and PHP was very straight forward and got the job done of a portfolio: present your job in a clear way.

## My first version
I was at university student, reading books in the library learning HTML and CSS and trying to figure it out how to create a brand identity for me, which indeed is the hardest thing to design on earth, but I learned a lot from this experience. It took me almost 2 months to edit all the project assets and release a somehow stable version and got me my first design job!

## My second version 
This one was a bit more refined, as I was still in the same library, but this time learning JQuery and PHP to create a more solid version. The main objective still was to present my projects, and I did want to create a blog with notes at the time, but could not figure it out how to build it in my own deadline and decided to keep this idea for later.

## My third version 
Later on, I would dabble on the idea of creating a new version of my portfolio, until I finally decided to try again, despite the effort it would presumably take. This time, I created with Webflow, when I decided to improve my visual skills and create a website with motion, css effects.
The only thing that was missing was the notes system. I tried creating with the CMS on Webflow, but I didn't want to get attached to their pricing system (since I mostly host my websites on github pages). I already had some good notes written, but still a bit ashamed on presenting them to the world.

## This version
Finally we reach this version. After deciding to take programming seriously and learning computer science from OSSU, I decided to build the website that I always wanted, no matter how long it would take. To my surprise, I discovered React, Tailwind and NextJS which almost feels like cheating compared to Jquery. Maybe it was because I didn't have a lot of experience programming back then, but this time it felt so easy. I finally created a notes section on my portfolio and my Google Drive will thank me for that, because I have a good amount of knowledge to share here.

Reflecting on this journey, creating a personal website is one of the most fun and challenging projects one can take. The idea of questioning your identity and how to present the most interesting parts of yourself is no easy task, but produces for sure a very satisfying output. This time, I expect to gradually improve this website throughout the years, and not do a total revamp every 2 to 4 years.
