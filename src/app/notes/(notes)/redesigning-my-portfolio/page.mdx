# Redesigning my portfolio
<time> Posted: September 07, 2024 </time>

The idea of profoundly reflecting on your identity, having a life crisis, and translating the most interesting parts of yourself into a website always sounded exciting to me. In this article, I give a general brief of what I was looking for when building all the versions of my portfolio.

## Version 1
During my college years, I embarked on the journey of creating my own website. I set out to challenge myself, learning and writing code using library books, and focusing solely on HTML and CSS.

The result was a straightforward solution that did the job of a portfolio: present your job clearly. Editing all the project assets and releasing a stable version took me almost two months, and it got me my first internship in a design company!

## Version 2
For my second attempt, I was very familiar with HTML and CSS, and I wanted to challenge myself to learn more about Javascript and PHP.

This version also took me two months to release. My main objective remained to present my projects, and I decided to focus on animations and motion aspects with JQuery and Boostrap. 

## Version 3
For this version, I was trying to test and understand the hype surrounding the Webflow solution. I always disliked no-code solutions because of their limitations, but Webflow seemed different.

I liked creating this version on the platform because it was user-friendly for quickly creating a website with motion and CSS effects. I also tried Framer, but since they didn't offer the possibility of exporting the code, it was a no-go.

## Version 4
Finally, we reach this version. After studying programming seriously and learning computer science at OSSU, I decided to build the website I always wanted, no matter how long it would take. 

A friend recommended React, Tailwind, and NextJS, which almost feels like cheating compared to JQuery's complexity. Maybe there was a bias around my programming level then, but it was easy this time. 

## Ending Thoughts
This time, I expect to gradually improve this website throughout the years rather than do a total revamp every 2 to 4 years. I plan to incorporate more advanced features, experiment with new technologies, and continue sharing my learning and evolving journey in web development and design.
